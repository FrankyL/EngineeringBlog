This site is a collection of my personal projects, experiments, and the occasional freelance work (if it’s worth showing off).</p><p></p><p></p><p>I like stuff that is easy to repair and modify, and to do that, I need modules, so don't expect me to integrate any ESP or SAMD21 chips anytime soon. The modularity is the point, even if I have to sacrifice size for it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Abandon all hope too if ye wish to see elegant designs around here, I have chosen the path of functions over form when I ended up going into EE B.Eng (NUS 1st choice) instead of Industrial Design (NUS 3rd choice) back then. The most elegant design around here is going to be something retro probably, Cassette Futurism is something I really dig. Basically, sacrificing functions and reparability in favor of form is something that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">really </span></strong>grinds my gear (looking at you <strong>Apple</strong>, you get extra grudge from me for also spreading that philosophy, you too <strong>Samsung</strong>).</p><p></p><p></p><p>Along the way, I also do quite a bit of mechanical design and 3D printing (I cleared my M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering so I know quite a bit about Materials and stuff), especially for casing, mount, or motion-related parts. I prioritized making things that work, refinement comes later (I hope...probably when I'm bored), so don't be surprised if things are functional but janky as hell, it's just part of the process.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Also I will talk about JLPT sometimes (it's kind of an on and off thing for me), I can read Katakana, Hiragana and around N4/N3 level of Kanji (N2 / N1 levels are mostly guesstimates from my Chinese vocabs, my JP grammar is truly cmi, I learnt mostly from watching Vtubers and Seiyuu radio shows so I wing it most of the time). I can understand / speak English, Chinese (Mandarin 普通话) , Bahasa Indonesia, Hokkien (Fujian 福建话 / 闽南话) and Japanese, but JP is mostly a hobby thing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Engineering and product crafting is kinda like an artform to me, I think most Mechanical and PCB Designers will agree. Sometimes, I wing it, sometimes I calculate, whatever it takes to get what I want. So don't be too surprised with the range of shenanigans this blog can get up to, a lot of it is truly just for fun.<br>Surprise fun fact: I was a self-taught freelance illustrator (mostly online, but I did a semester-break stint at Collateral Damage Studio) before I even graduate as an engineer and pretty sure the artsy-fartsy side of me never really disappeared, the urge to create fun-sounding nonsense at a whim is definitely infecting the engineer side haha.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hit me up if you want to collab or need someone to rig a prototype up for you! (Not sure if you can DM me on this blog, but if you can't, my email is at franky.laurentis@gmail.com , you should be able to also contact me on Youtube through the Shorts)</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
