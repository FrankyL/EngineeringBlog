If you are wondering why I went out of my way to use gears: The servo itself can only rotate from 0 to 180 deg, the prism in this case is 360/3 = 120 deg from one side to the next. Thus, at least i need to have something that can rotate from 0 to 240 deg cuz the prism need to be able to rotate through 3 states. I just used 2 to 1 gear ratio to expand the total rotation from 180 to 360.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/c2cp\\u002d\\u002dN6jyQ\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/c2cp--N6jyQ</div>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:embed --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>YT vid above is the signage rotation test (i.e. literally just change between states).

First time using this filament, pretty cool, stronger than PLA and not as pain in the ass as ABS. ABS is supposedly the most \"overpowered\" but without a cover to maintain temperature, it's the most troublesome of the trio I mentioned above (also you won't believe the number of glue sticks I bought from Popular just to make sure the damn print won't wrap). The higher hotplate temperature occasionally also caused the microcontroller in the 3D printer to freeze and whoop-dee-doo there goes your progress.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">V1.

I think there's just a small difference in Indo culture about fighting, I remember back in Indo, the shoving ritual don't really exist, using hands simply means \"it's go time!\" I think the SG bully mentality just never went away in SME bosses, they \"shove, shove, shove\" until someone clocks them in the eye, then acting like you are the one at fault.

LOL Gtfo outta here. If I can make fun of foreigners doing éªå in Indo, it's then hypocritical of me to do the same in SG, thus the only morally consistent option for me is to quit. Which I did. Then it led to the TADM fight over $80. I think it's important to do things by principle. I have promised them that I will escalate if they play games, guess what, it's a promise, not a threat.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I think autonomy is the best path forward and status / prestige has value only if it serves that end. Thus I structured my life to achieve autonomy as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Clarity / Acquiring a usable and predictive method to view the world</h2>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>What does clarity means? It means I take actions with the maximum amount of info prepped and ready beforehand. What do I want out of life? What are the possible steps to do so? What is the best, most efficient options I have? How do I structure my life in order to have the maximum number of attack vectors to achieve as many avenues to my original aim i.e. 1 path closed, 10 more to go? How should you view the world in a way that allows you to predict, anticipate and make use of agents or  institutions against your opponents?</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>That's the idea of clarity, I just want to achieve autonomy as early and as efficiently as possible. The more you think and strategize and understand how to make use of the world around you, the better and more effective you are. I remember taking a bet against 2 friends on Iswaran's sentence for corruption. 1 said it will remain 6 months as originally intended, 1 said it will be reduced to 3 months because they will protect their own. I said 1 year minimum because the <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">optics </span></strong>of merely 6 months for high level corruption is absolutely horrible for SG's law based reputation. I was right. If one understand incentives, it is possible to predict and make use of institutions like TADM properly to crush opponents like the 3rd boss.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>If I have a really secure and airtight dossier and the other guy did a blatant lie, and <strong>IF </strong>TADM side with the other guy. TADM would basically commit the equivalent of <strong>reputational suicide</strong> assuming that I go and post the documents and start shouting from the rooftops (posting on Linkedin and everywhere I can find). <strong>TADM would want to preserve the reputation of MOM and SG employment</strong>, therefore the chances of them pulling a \"kampung justice\" by siding with the other guy (Singaporean) would be <strong>extremely low</strong>. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">This applies to SG in general, the institutions wish to be seen as \"just\" and \"lawful\"</span></strong>, as long as you follow this guideline and bait the other guy into doing something blatantly \"unjust\" or \"unlawful\" (at least the 2nd and 3rd SME bosses are obviously dumb and arrogant enough to fall for it), you can nudge them to destroy any <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">\"bad\"</span></strong> actors.

I advocate for people to plan several steps ahead but always keep the flame of your ideology/ values alive. E.g. Just because my M.Sc ME took less effort than M.Sc CS, doesn't mean I don't respect effort anymore, it is a useful tool to override MBA opinion which will be useful to achieve autonomy faster. If you managed to hop into a govt job that allows you to chill, go use the free time to learn new things, increase your skillsets, add new tools to your toolkit, if you have a biz idea, start building it on the down low, just because you are seen as \"coasting\" from the outside does not mean you are.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Be flexible, be pragmatic but remember your end-game</strong>.
