Partially a biography just in case my kids decided to ask me and I forgot details or something. Also a record about my dad and mum in case I forget anything.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Self-employment is the only way forward</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Let's start from the beginning, my dad is a civil engineer manager working for a pulp and paper company, hardly got time for me back then when I was a kid but oh well such is life, he did his best. My mom is an admin, the head secretary for the regional branch in fact. From the way my parents talk about their time there, seems like it sucked balls, more for my dad, my mum is more neutral about it all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>They damn nearly sunk (financially) before my mum decided to do a hail mary and started a water filtering depot (Air minum ERSE at Perawang, you can look it up on Google Maps), good money, evergreen business actually. I have told Singaporeans about this before and they are honestly baffled at the idea and how it works, but in more ways than one, it is a genius idea:</p><p></p><p></p><ol class="wp-block-list"><p></p><li>Everyone drinks water, and they <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">LOVE </span></strong>water that is not dirty and don't taste like Chlorine (looking at you Newater)</li><p></p><p></p><li>The first water depot store that passes the Government's health safety inspection (0 bribing, no sir.)</li><p></p><p></p><li>My parents have connections into the factory in the town, and they are basically the sole supplier for years</li><p></p></ol><p></p><p></p><p>My dad has another business running in parallel that started like a few years prior, it's a relatively small plantation for palm trees (Sawit in Indonesian). Also very good money, but it takes time to ramp up in production, around 4-5 years, basically a really long investment.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My dad's last biz as of this writing is swiftlet's nest, 燕窝. This one Singaporeans generally know, they are also really baffled when I am very flippant about my mum bringing those that are unsellable (flaky and thin usually) to SG and making soups of it for our own consumption. (They go like "Wah, aren't those really expensive!?") Well I mean the birds made the nests at the 4th floor of my parent's shophouse, why would it be expensive?</p><p></p><p></p><p>In essence, my dad semi-retired since the age of 40, he barely works just manage and keep things running, coming back and forth between SG and Indo once every 1-2 months for 10 days each time. Imagine having 100-120 days worth of annual leaves haha. My mum is a housewife since 2000, and while it is no less tougher than working, I would say it is a far more meaningful job (taking care and educating kids vs making money for some stranger).</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>I want that life for myself, and I want to have time for my kids in the future, the best path forward is to go this route as early as possible and making it work.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And if no girls want me sadge :'^( , I have 100 more hobbies I want to try out, being a wagie doesn't allow it. Thus, <strong>this is the way</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Also I will be brutally honest now, who in their right mind want to work until they are in their 60s then forced into retirement, what if you still have kids in uni? Are you okay with it? Ask yourself honestly and think for a bit, and no, don't start your reply with "Bo pian", that just drains your spite and motivation by half. You <strong>know </strong>the answer. Anyone <strong>knows</strong> the answer. How you respond is your own. I have Singaporean friends telling me it's impossible and it will be risking my career at a chance at this, but I will be damned if I don't at least <strong>try</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hell fuck it, my career has been derailed since 2020, what do I have to lose?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Of course, I know some people who unironically thinks climbing the corporate ladder is the path to "adulting". You do you, I am simply saying the opinion of one who thinks otherwise. I say it sucks and they will never mention how you are never really in control, much less the fact that the "ladder" can be kicked out from under you</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>My basic assumption in life is self-employment trumps being employed by others, I guess, and this factors into a lot of my life's decisions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Why learn so many skills? Why such a huge breadth from EE / ME / Material Science / IOT / Robotics / Biomed / Additive Manufacturing?</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>Independence in case I can't find a collaborator for a business. Worst case I will need to be a one-man-army for a while and I better be able to step up to that role.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My dad dabbled from civil engineering, built then designed the plumbing and electrical system of all 4 of his own shop houses, learnt how water filtration and cleansing works, learnt how to plant palm trees and grow them, learnt swiftlet's preferred habitat, how to attract them and the pacing on harvesting their nests.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My mom has background in aquaculture, climbed to head secretary in 5 years of working, side hustling the whole time, and the water depot was her idea, she is the one who first figured out who to hire to build the first iteration of the filtration system.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Compared to them, I looked like an over-specialized nerd haha. They basically did it all from nothing, no inheritance, no nothing other than their education. I have 10 times the resources and a higher education, what kind of massive loser will I be if I can't at least achieve the same level of success?</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>Also I have brought this up since the M.Sc. Mechanical Engineering posts.</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>It's "street cred" for a future business. Yes, I mean it 100%, now not even MBAs will question my credentials, isn't it?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Try to imagine if I am still B.Eng. trying to sell them an IoT product? Now I can shut them down by using the fact that I am the same level as them but Engineering.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I can do ME stuff long before this ME M.Sc. but now on paper, no one will question it.</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>Also I have been freelancing during the weekends this whole time (since at least 2023?) but that's beside the point, I would say it helped to boost confidence in me being able to create solutions and products that people want and willing to pay for.</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">I have been planning on self-employment before I even graduate B.Eng.</span></strong></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Zero-rent strategy</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Now, SG rent is <strong>stupid expensive</strong>, I remember reading a headline in 2025 that a rental for a clinic is 52000 SGD per month. WTF. How are you supposed to make it back every month?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Indonesian pro-tip for biz: 0 rent + minimize expenditure = easy to make net profit. There are satay shops near my parent's house at Pekanbaru that has been open since the 1990s and there's barely anyone there, how is it still open? It's their own house LMAO, 0 rent thus they only care about making net profit, even if the revenue is only enough to make back the meat and ketupat (rice pack thingies), they don't care cuz the profit is just 0, not 0 minus rent.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Now taking note of the story above, Batam is now a no-brainer if my next step is self-employment, not continuing in SG. SG strat for biz is literally "go big or go bust", which sucks cuz even my parent's most profitable biz took a year to get going and 1 year of rent in SG is absolutely punishing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Also another big reason is I have lots of stuff in SG haha, too many figures and plamos and since it's impossible for me to get BTO (need to rush to get a wife (3D human wife, not waifu) and I thought that's just a horrible idea) or condos (debt slavery for another 30 years) here, I chose the best option I have at the moment, easier to ship stuff to Batam than Pekanbaru. Thus, I sealed my path forward by buying a Batam home. A bit expensive relative to Batam's average houses but compared to SG, the bang for buck is so much better.</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Minimize expenditure, extend runway, grow the biz, will be my main strategy</span></strong></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Concept of a 'good deal'</h2><p></p><p></p><p>I have people who told me that SG condo and BTO holds value better than Batam house. (Clowned on, even :^| )</p><p></p><p></p><p>Yea if I can buy em without sinking my whole life into a debt hole or derailing it with a rushed marriage, I would too.</p><p></p><p></p><p>They are not wrong, but I simply think my priority is different, that is all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Short tangent time!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Option 1: Get a condo!</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>2-3 million SGD for basically what amounts to a chicken coop in the middle of the sky. By the gods do I hate shitty deals, hell I shit on Apple all the damn time for shitty deals. This is the shittest one of em all. If you want to flex, actually flex the whole way, get a landed property, now that's actually impressive, there's the huge upside too that you don't roll for nutjob neighbors above and below you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>IMO, people that advocates for condos typically just want the prestige of 5C and the idea you are no longer a normal "pleb" in an HDB. I don't really agree with it, especially when they start acting like they are better than everyone else.</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>Option 2: Get a BTO!</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>Need to rush a marriage = bad idea, I have seen people rushing to get married to do legal stuff and I swear 90% of them ends like shit. The guy loses half his fortune and the girl wasted their precious time. (Asian context, don't pull your whole western thing here, you know what I'm talking about, don't be slow.) I honestly just thought this is a horrible idea in every way possible.</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>Option 3: Resale HDB!</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>Ownership rules still the same BTO, need 2 PRs to own 1 and rushing marriage is my main gripe.</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>Also, here's a quick conspiracy theory :^) , <strong>SG feels like it's in a housing bubble</strong>, why else you think your gubmen keep importing new citizens? People want their HDB prices to keep rising, but citizens dun have kids, pop go down = demand for HDB go down. Demand goes down = Price goes down. People don't like price going down now, do they?</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>The main lever to keep price going up </strong>is by <strong>ensuring pop keeps going up</strong>. However, pop go up until when? Is SG not over-populated enough? What happens if people stop coming in or SG runs out of space?</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Real estate investment in SG is good on the surface, but either it's the shittest deal on Earth or requires you to take insane risks as you rush for a BTO/HDB.</span></strong></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The spirit of being an engineer to me vs in SG</h2><p></p><p></p><p>I have a small story to tell about my dad.</p><p></p><p></p><p>He used to be a civil engineer with hundreds of subordinates and construction workers under him to develop roads and bridges for the town of Perawang decades ago. As one can tell, their schedule can be irregular cuz their work is really affected by weather so they are also reliant on getting work done during OT hours. Then one day fuckin HR gave a decree that OT is suspended cuz some fuckwit up in corporate have been exploiting it, not thinking that such a heavy handed move will ripple down everywhere.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My dad responded by just asking his subordinates to work the office hours. Things goes to shit and half constructed roads lost their shapes within a week. He got called up to corporate to get berated maybe even demoted or fired.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This is where the twist comes in, in the meeting room he goes <strong>"OK now that you hauled me all the way here, may I know the fucking HR monkey who implemented that new brain-dead no OT rule?"</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Yes, he intentionally got himself hauled to corporate just so he can go and berate the head of HR instead. He went all the way haha</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>Ohh no OT huh, you limp wristed HR lots think it's easy to work during thunderstorms in Perawang huh, how many lightning rods you installed over there for protection? That's right, Zero.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You fucks know how muddy it gets out there when it rains?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Why don't you get out of your comfy AC room and do the work for 1 week if you think it's so easy?</p><p></p><p></p><p>These construction workers is already barely making ends meet, hardly goes back to their family, and now they have to deal with moronic monkeys up here fucking every thing up like the monkeys you are.</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>After a long scolding sesh from this mere regional head of engineering to the HRs in front of the company owner and the C-Suites, somehow got the HR demoted instead.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To this day his former subordinates around Perawang and Pekanbaru still respects him and showed as such whenever they encounter one another.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A rare engineer win for once, I think even rarer in SG.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I think that also informed my worldview quite a bit</p><p></p><p></p><ol class="wp-block-list"><p></p><li>Don't be a pussy, show up for your subordinates</li><p></p><p></p><li>HR can be really stupid (and sometimes, they are pretending to be stupid so that they don't get sued *wink*), and they're definitely <strong>not</strong> your friend. We should not hesitate to fight back, but at the same time, fight back strategically. They're not omnipotent gods and even then, a god that bleed can also be killed. They are way more powerful than you, but so does a raid boss.</li><p></p><p></p><li>Engineers are out here building real things, entire towns, cities even, have some damn pride in the craft.</li><p></p></ol><p></p><p></p><p>I have seen my engineering managers in SG, be it in SME, Unis or Polys, groveling at HR, not complaining when they get voluntold to do stupid shit and scared of even getting into HR's field of view.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here is an engineer, with <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">decades</span> </strong>worth of invaluable experience, groveling at what amounts to be the ultimate corporate lapdogs. There is just something deeply and profoundly, sad and pitiable about all this.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However in SG, you can't really escape HR, can you? As long as you are still someone's employee, you answer to HR, which is also another reason why I'm so hell-bent at self-employment.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you are sick of corporate games and HR? Why not take the 3rd route? No one ever said you have to be in SG for the rest of your life, hell, to Singaporeans, the 3 months visa-free thing to lots of countries could become your main advantage, lots of countries want entrepreneurs and inventors. (You can be a respected asset with your own company in TW, JP, etc.) I don't think life is a zero-sum game, and I don't think one is a loser for not aspiring to the 5C. If SG corporates don't want to cherish or respect engineering, you are in great demand everywhere else.</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">I still want to be an engineer and build stuff, I just don't want to eat shit as someone's employee for the rest of my life.</span></strong></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">SG SME SUCKS, govt, uni or MNC jobs treat you far better with better pay. I can understand why no S'poreans bother with them</h2><p></p><p></p><p>As of now in 2025, I have been thru 3 SMEs, 1 Uni and 1 Poly. Poly is alright, uni is the best one. SME is pure "bruh moment" in my experience.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Goddamn SG SMEs suck. Sometimes I want to give them the benefit of the doubt cuz my parents are indo SME owners and I plan to be one too, but my exp with SMEs in SG has been: "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">treated like disposable hot trash</span></strong>." Hard to sympathize when SME owners here whine that they are being crushed by MNCs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Maybe due to natural selection (I speculate SG talents overwhelmingly choose to go MNCs while it's more popular or acceptable in Indo as an end-game, so SG SME owners is selected mostly from scumbags who can't find a job anymore, trashy opportunists, reluctant inheritors or the rare authentic startup entrepreneur material, I dunno just a speculation), or also maybe due to the classic Boomer Chinese mentality + oversized ego from being the "boss" (i.e. Mini-emperors). I really want to give the benefit of the doubt, but it is really painful to get screwed and disappointed every single time.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Some stories on my SME experiences</h2><p></p><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">1st SME Oil company</span></strong>: I met my long time otaku friend here, dude is a legend, climbed up slowly from ITE to Poly to NTU. Nothing but respect, lots of people would have accepted their lot in life. All in all a really dry, boring, braindead job, I got let go of my own fault, I just don't want to go to lunch with the higher ups. Learnt my lesson. 4/10, just really fucking boring and uncreative.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">2nd SME Robotics startup</span></strong>: Dogshit ass startup ran by a <strong>salesman</strong> CEO. He tried to <strong>micromanage engineers</strong>, caused issues then blame the engineers back. Classic narcissism and incapability of reflection. The main robot case is designed by a fresh grad, he put soapy water tank on top of electronics (amateur mistake, but hey he's fresh, I will give benefit of the doubt), this dude went and <strong>make 10 of em cuz it's cheap</strong> and then force the development along this direction with this shitty ass shell, then <strong>blaming the fresh grad for the design</strong>. We thought he might be autistic but I know autists that are genuinely kind, this piece of garbage is just an asshole.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2/10, learnt a lot of things including how to screw with SMEs using the Employment Act and MOM if they are trying to pull funny nonsense. This trash really thinks he can say <strong>he need 1 month to let us go and we need 2 months to leave.</strong> (pro-tip: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">it must be the same</span></strong>, if it's not, you follow <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">MOM guideline</span></strong>).</p><p></p><p></p><p>For fuck's sake, read the damned Employment Act or consult ChatGPT on what to pay attention to, damned incompetents, what a bunch of morons, you know you're beyond stupid when a freshie with 1 year work exp can outsmart your shit-ass-bottom-of-the-barrel contract.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Lastly, I thought this worthless insect will put up a good fight, but no, he backed down the moment I copy-pasted Employment Act into the email. <strong>OH FUCK OFF WHERE DID THE ARROGANT BLUSTER GO HUH?</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">3rd SME Robotics training tuition center</span></strong>: Really short gig doing robot training for primary school kids (basically <strong>骗吃</strong>, something I also despise) during weekends. Same issue with Robotics startup, boss got oversized ego.</p><p></p><p></p><p>First time I encounter pay issue too, they promised 1 month prior will pay on the 15th, that 15th is Sunday</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>They said no one working that day cuz Sunday, after y'know promising multiple times, in the age of Paynow, oh fuck off. Also they should have paid me once on the previous month's 15th, I quit on the 25th previous month cuz I don't trust these fuckers</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>The principal who promised it then asked me to go find the boss because the boss haven't transferred to her <strong>(Already I'm like Wot?, that's your job, not mine)</strong>. I contacted the boss in a group chat (not sure where else), then he ejected me from the group, said I am being hostile when I am no longer trusting, saying that he will "<strong>see when lor</strong>" and "<strong>pay slowly lor</strong>" about the salary payment. Classic gaslighting so amateurish even ChatGPT can recognize it.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Disgustingly pathetic cockroaches. 0/10</span></strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Do note that they went thru all these over $240, later over $80.</strong> Honestly I am so sick of getting treated like shit and I am actually giddy for them to not pay so that I can actually sic TADM on them. The principal like the weasel she is, tried to just pay just $160 saying the 1st lesson does not count when she has clearly stated it verbally during our first meeting.</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p><strong>Note that they have not once denied that I worked 3 lessons this whole time and I gleefully wrote a complete timeline for TADM using WhatsApp screenshots.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Also pro-tip: MOM doesn't give a single shit that there's no written contract. You are promised pay, you do work, you must get paid or else the MOM has mandate to step in and whoop their ass. DO NOT LET THESE SCUMS GET AWAY WITH WAGE THEFT.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>pro-tip 2: Document everything, even WhatsApp screenshots, the more the better, build a paper trail even with WhatsApp. The principal claimed I don't work on the 1st lesson and the boss claimed I don't exist within their company. Both can be disproven with a single screenshot each, I built a whole dossier of screenshots and proofs of their IRL identities behind their WhatsApp monikers to crush it proper, then point out the principals payment to me invalidated the boss' claim that I don't exist. These idiots thought it's a good idea to bluff and tell an easily disproven bald faced lie at TADM of all places</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Pro-tip 3: This piece of shit threatened me over a review stating they don't pay their staff properly. I figured out how to contact pro bono lawyers. Use the email help@probono.sg or go down to one of their branches, they will help you for free. This fucker uses legal threat as intimidation tactic, don't fall for it, know your legal rights.</strong></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reflection on SMEs</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The first one is actually decent even though boring, but I would have hated my life if I go along with them. Me getting let go set my path into IoT and Robotics, both are sectors I genuinely loved.

Perhaps they have never encounter someone who would fight back over $200 bux? Or they just never expected someone to not even bother to talk (<strong>I know they are stalling for time, I like doing 'dumb' shit cuz they are fun, not because I am actually stupid</strong>) and just report them to MOM? Why risk the entire business over $200? Why do...<strong>sub-optimal decisions</strong>? Are these people that incapable of strategic forecasting?

Just spam your resumes and leave."</strong>, my argument goes like "You planning to apply for PR here?", he said that the boss will pick a fight with him over that (He actually did, but with me. To demonstrate how dumb this guy is, he said "<strong>Helping you apply for PR does not benefit the company.</strong>" When I am <strong>the only 1 of 2 engineers left</strong>. Yes, I know, really fucking stupid is already an understatement with this one.) I then replied with "Then what's the point? This place sucks, you and I don't have faith this place will last, <strong>you stay = it collapse sooner or later</strong>, <strong>u leave = got an actual chance at PR</strong>" Dude started spamming LinkedIn applications the next day.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To this day the 2nd boss still thought I convinced everyone to leave when it was an open secret everyone with any sense has no faith the company will last. On the day I left, he asked the only engineer left whether he wrote a Glassdoor review. It was his review actually, but he said it was me, obviously well duh, anyone asked that in office will <strong>never </strong>say "<strong>Yeah, it was me who wrote a critical 1-star review on Glassdoor! Tehepero! ;^P</strong>" This other engineer messaged me at 9AM stating he is sorry about this and said the boss going nuts and gonna message me soon. Good thing I love me a good argument, eh. Basically he is incredulous I denied it was mine, and said that "the other guy denied it, therefore it must be you!", I responded with <strong>"If you asked anyone in office to their face whether it is their critical 1-star Glassdoor review, and you expect anything other than a "no", you must either be really fucking stupid, or born yesterday. Fuck off moron. You have a brain, use it."</strong> Which riled him up even more.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The 2nd boss, I have to admit, has a silver tongue, really good at talking and rhetorical arguments, I will never win against him in 1v1 arguments. So I just stayed home and negotiate through Whatsapp, LOL so much for 30 years worth of salesman talking skills, I might not be rhetorically as skilled, but I can still recognize moronic arguments, just that I am not that good at rebutting it on site.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Honestly, I think I subconsciously promised myself to never let things like this slide ever again, even when it's not happening to me, much less when it's actually happening to me.

If you are brazen enough to openly commit wage theft, go fight TADM openly instead of pussying out at the first mention of "proper channels".

I think there's just a small difference in Indo culture about fighting, I remember back in Indo, the shoving ritual don't really exist, using hands simply means "it's go time!" I think the SG bully mentality just never went away in SME bosses, they "shove, shove, shove" until someone clocks them in the eye, then acting like you are the one at fault.

Was it dumb as hell, yeah. Was it rock as fuck, hell yeah. This person has convictions, follow through with it and struggle with everything they've got. No matter if they fail, the fact they even tried an offbeat path and took the risk already earned my respect.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I know of a Singaporean YouTube Channel who moved to Japan with his family, and learning Japanese and everything.

Competence / Conflict is a part of life and I expect the best performance when you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">start </span></strong>the conflict</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The thing that disgusted me most about the 2nd and 3rd SME bosses in the section above is not actually the part they are bullies. It's the part where they are <strong>weak</strong> bullies. They are not worthy opponents, just a punching bag, and punching bags are a chore to fight after a bit. I just want to crush them completely as quick as possible. There's no challenge and nothing to learn. Just a pathetic waste of time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I expect the 3rd boss to take things seriously after I got TADM involved and he shot himself in the foot on turn 1. It's not fun when I have prepared 3 dossiers worth of stuff to fight him with. It's like facing off against a boss in game and they flopped and die after 1 hit. You can be an evil asshole all you want, but if you're competent and actually a challenging threat that I can learn from, you will still get my begrudging respect.</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>Maybe it's just my obsession with command and conquer and the civ game series back in the day but often I assess things with the intent of intercepting and denying my opponents their bests moves. E.g. the situation allows for x amount of moves, the opponents can react in y moves, I can use z moves to deny them their best choices out of y moves. That kinda thing, and when they shot themselves I go like ???? <strong>But why tho? </strong>I think I just expect the head of a company to be competent and have some semblance of self preservation instincts...or you know if you need to login to a portal using your singpass, at least tell a plausibly deniable lie...?</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>Conflict is a natural part of life, it is also the most direct way to gain resources and dominance. I expect people to take conflicts seriously, because I will be going in with maxxed out units and predicting your moves to intercept. If you think like a bully, be prepared to get crushed.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Autonomy / Don't fall for a mirage.</h2><p></p><p></p><p>3rd one is the simplest, I want to spend my time doing stuff that have meaning to me. Working on my own company &gt; other people's company cuz I have full stakes of what is happening. If I hire a moron to manage and he fucked things up, that's on me. There's no more middle manager threatening me PIP and what not, hell I'm the one who threatens PIP if not outright letting go now. But that's the point my parents and the SME bosses is showing, the business now depends on you. You have the full responsibility to keep things running or fuck everything up.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A wealthy mid manager is still beholden to their managers. Their managers still beholden to the c suites. The c suites still beholden to the board and investors. All mirage, all golden handcuffs, not my idea of a long term solution.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Consistency / Don't be a hypocrite, or try your best not to be</h2><p></p><p></p><p>I admire consistent people. Hell I aspire to be as morally consistent and anti-hypocritical as much as possible. I quit the 3rd boss' company simply because it's just a 骗吃 operation, we teach half assed robotics to students who can barely do maths, then they tried to ask us to train the student to go to the AI competition. LOL Gtfo outta here. If I can make fun of foreigners doing 骗吃 in Indo, it's then hypocritical of me to do the same in SG, thus the only morally consistent option for me is to quit. Which I did. Then it led to the TADM fight over $80. I think it's important to do things by principle. I have promised them that I will escalate if they play games, guess what, it's a promise, not a threat.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I think autonomy is the best path forward and status / prestige has value only if it serves that end. Thus I structured my life to achieve autonomy as fast as possible.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Clarity / Acquiring a usable and predictive method to view the world</h2><p></p><p></p><p>What does clarity means? It means I take actions with the maximum amount of info prepped and ready beforehand. What do I want out of life? What are the possible steps to do so? What is the best, most efficient options I have? How do I structure my life in order to have the maximum number of attack vectors to achieve as many avenues to my original aim i.e. 1 path closed, 10 more to go? How should you view the world in a way that allows you to predict, anticipate and make use of agents or institutions against your opponents?</p><p></p><p></p><p>That's the idea of clarity, I just want to achieve autonomy as early and as efficiently as possible. The more you think and strategize and understand how to make use of the world around you, the better and more effective you are. I remember taking a bet against 2 friends on Iswaran's sentence for corruption. 1 said it will remain 6 months as originally intended, 1 said it will be reduced to 3 months because they will protect their own. I said 1 year minimum because the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">optics </span></strong>of merely 6 months for high level corruption is absolutely horrible for SG's law based reputation. I was right. If one understand incentives, it is possible to predict and make use of institutions like TADM properly to crush opponents like the 3rd boss.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If I have a really secure and airtight dossier and the other guy did a blatant lie, and <strong>IF </strong>TADM side with the other guy. TADM would basically commit the equivalent of <strong>reputational suicide</strong> assuming that I go and post the documents and start shouting from the rooftops (posting on Linkedin and everywhere I can find). <strong>TADM would want to preserve the reputation of MOM and SG employment</strong>, therefore the chances of them pulling a "kampung justice" by siding with the other guy (Singaporean) would be <strong>extremely low</strong>. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">This applies to SG in general, the institutions wish to be seen as "just" and "lawful"</span></strong>, as long as you follow this guideline and bait the other guy into doing something blatantly "unjust" or "unlawful" (at least the 2nd and 3rd SME bosses are obviously dumb and arrogant enough to fall for it), you can nudge them to destroy any <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">"bad"</span></strong> actors. Yes, <strong>even </strong>their fellow Singaporeans.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Pragmatism / Adjust on the fly, the end-game comes first, uphold your principles when it makes sense</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Do note that just because you value something does not mean you can't defer them for a bit to get ahead so that you can achieve more of the things you value more easily. I advocate for people to plan several steps ahead but always keep the flame of your ideology/ values alive. E.g. Just because my M.Sc ME took less effort than M.Sc CS, doesn't mean I don't respect effort anymore, it is a useful tool to override MBA opinion which will be useful to achieve autonomy faster. If you managed to hop into a govt job that allows you to chill, go use the free time to learn new things, increase your skillsets, add new tools to your toolkit, if you have a biz idea, start building it on the down low, just because you are seen as "coasting" from the outside does not mean you are.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Be flexible, be pragmatic but remember your end-game</strong>. Plan accordingly, adjust on the fly, if your opponents has deployed their WMD, time to deploy the zone troopers straight to their base.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><figure class="wp-image-935"><img loading="lazy" src="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/11/image-60.png" alt="" style="aspect-ratio:1.9474224250787249;width:457px;height:auto" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/11/responsive/image-60-xs.png 640w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/11/responsive/image-60-sm.png 768w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/11/responsive/image-60-md.png 1024w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/11/responsive/image-60-lg.png 1366w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/11/responsive/image-60-xl.png 1600w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/11/responsive/image-60-2xl.png 1920w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>Kinda missed CNC.

We're not stupid alright, she knows they are 高高在上 (arrogant and elitist) kinda people with their landed property in SG. Decades later, these cunts got the cajones to say "They are the younger ones, they should come give us a call if they want contact." to a 3rd party. What I want to say is: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">fuck them</span></strong>. Their whole side of the family are not only strangers, I will side with their enemies against them, <strong>gladly</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If there are people who looked down on your family for whatever reason. Why do you still want to "prove them wrong"? Are the people who insult and laugh at your family behind your back even worthy of civil conversation? The idea that I should "prove them wrong" is just abhorrent to me. It's like I desire their respect of something. Well, I don't, If I have their respect, I will gladly chuck it into the incinerator. The only viable options left to me is either <strong>indifference </strong>or <strong>total war</strong>, and by the gods, I hope they give me the excuse to do the latter one day.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Have some self-respect, don't seek to please people who looked down on you. Do what you want for your own end-game, because it aligns with your values, not because you want some loser's respect.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Also to the grandaunt who at least maintain contact, we know you're bullshitting us when you said "<strong>I am PR only, can't help to sponsor you in SG</strong>" even though my mom begged you for help.<strong> I know</strong> that <strong>you know</strong> that's bullshit, not even a hollow <strong>"let me check"</strong>. You're also fucking scum, give me a good enough reason and I will come after your side of the "relatives" too. A stranger (our landlord) at the time helped us out without complaint nor asking for money.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Blood of the covenant is thicker than water of the womb, often, you can't rely on anyone except <strong>maybe </strong>your closest circle. Hence, why I always advocate for independence and autonomy during peace time, and to go all out and have fun escalating when some bastard is messing with you. Build independence and self-sufficiency, go scorched earth on your enemies, make an example out of them. If they spit on you when you have been graceful to them, don't entertain a "win-win" proposal when they are backed into the corner, destroy them so thoroughly that they can never do it to the next person.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion and reiteration</h2><p></p><p></p><ol class="wp-block-list"><p></p><li>About playing shitty societal "games"</li><p></p></ol><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p><strong>If a game is ass, not fun, not meaningful, and costs you the ultimate currency (time), why the hell are you still playing it?<br>Put it down.

It is now the age of multipolar chaos, and with chaos comes opportunity to topple the old powers. I believe people who are willing to take calculated gambles, tank failures, play the field against their opponents (going on the offensive) and plan long term will be able to thrive in the upcoming era.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Lady Luck smile on the bold, Lady Chaos destroys those who refuse to adapt.</strong></p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 9, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/tags/family/">family</a></li><li><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/tags/life/">life</a></li><li><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/tags/mental-health/">mental-health</a></li><li><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/tags/writing/">writing</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/authors/franky-laurentis/" rel="author">Franky Laurentis</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/the-making-of-a-modular-3d-printed-line-following-robot-kit-v1-in-progress-untested.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The Making of a Modular 3D-printed Line Following Robot Kit [V1-in progress-untested]</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/updated-esp32-based-ble-modular-arcade-controller-akecons-akekon.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> [UPDATED] ESP32 Based BLE Modular Arcade Controller (Akecons アケコン)</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/authors/franky-laurentis/" class="feed__author">Franky Laurentis</a> <time datetime="2025-06-10T10:45" class="feed__date">June 10, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/non-technical-some-ramblings-and-opinions.html">[Non-technical] Some ramblings and opinions</a></h3></header><p>On the topic of 骗吃 (pian chiak/pian chi) Hmm this is a topic that deviates from the usual of this blog, but I kinda want to have a conversation or at least write down my thoughts on this.
