This post is a little different from my usual technical write-ups. It’s part cultural reflection, part cautionary tale.</p><p></p><p></p><p>From ChatGPT, 骗吃 can be defined as:</p><p></p><p></p><p>The phrase literally means <strong>“to cheat and eat”</strong>, but culturally, it's:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p>A lightly contemptuous term for people who survive or thrive by leveraging <em>perception, connections, or appearances</em>, rather than <strong>actual capability, contribution, or hard work</strong>.</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>They’re not always outright frauds. They may:</p><p></p><p></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><p></p><li>Talk big but deliver little.</li><p></p><p></p><li>Secure roles via networking, not merit.</li><p></p><p></p><li>Coast on credentials or charisma.</li><p></p><p></p><li>Present themselves as experts, but are hollow inside.</li><p></p></ul><p></p><p></p><p>They’re not necessarily criminals — <strong>but they’re not truly respected</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So back in Indo, there used to be huge corporations in Sumatra that hired lots of people from let's say, country A (Developed Country) (back in the 90s-2000s) for whatever reason, ehh relations / nepotism probably. If you know, you know. These people from A however, to be very blunt, are underqualified at best. The idea of hiring one of them with Civil Engineering Degree yet unable to read maps or understand basic mapping scales is considered "common". There's jokes that these people used to sell "koyok" or "snake oil" figuratively, back home because that's how little life skills they have, but here they are in Indo withdrawing USD wages, coasting, slave-driving or even claiming the credits of similarly managerial but local colleagues.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Is this considered 骗吃? Obviously.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Then another sample, I know a person (English speaking developed country) who worked in Jakarta for a time as a vice-principal in an international school. Does he teach anything? Apparently not, or at least that is how it sounds to me when he explained his job, mostly admin work. Come back to his own country and can't find another job cuz apparently he is too big for F&amp;B to even provide for his family. The only job I heard him taking is security guard, political party employee (quits after a while, reason borders on conspiracy theory), and robotics trainer in a college (they let him go cuz he ain't got any technical skills). So is he 骗吃? Maybe? 80%? Sounds like it to me, the reason why he is hired in Jakarta and rose through the ranks quickly is cuz of his nationality, default language and a masters in educational management. However, at the same time, is it really his fault the market favors English speakers for an international school? That's the nuance, I think.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Should we be mad at the “snake oil salesmen” — or the people who keep buying their snake oil?</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Huge disclaimer before we continue: I am not saying the tuition center sucks in the coming story, I am criticizing 1 particular senior tutor and him setting the policy is his right to do within the tuition center if the bosses entrusted him with that.</span></strong></em></p><p></p><p></p><p><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">My main point has more to do with the issue of my personal principles</span></strong></em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em> on the concept of 骗吃</em></span></strong></p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><figure class="wp-image-434"><img loading="lazy" src="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/image-15.png" alt="" style="width:732px;height:auto" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-15-xs.png 640w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-15-sm.png 768w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-15-md.png 1024w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-15-lg.png 1366w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-15-xl.png 1600w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-15-2xl.png 1920w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Lastly is my point on why I decided to make a <a href="https://frankylau5.wordpress.com/2025/06/10/the-making-of-a-modular-3d-printed-line-following-robot-kit/">"Line Following Modular Education Kit Robot"</a>. I did a really short gig in a robotics tuition center to teach Lego Robots to kids. I mean, if it's just Lego, I would be less opposed to it actually, the "tutors" will basically double as a child care and that's about it. The issue is when a more senior tutor decides to sign up for AI Maker NRC competition for the kids, and then force this idea on every other robotics tutor. Just as it sounds, the competition requires the usage of AI for Computer vision. We are going to put aside the fact that half of the kids is below Primary 4 and maybe like 2 Upper Primary School kids.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><figure class="wp-image-628"><img loading="lazy" src="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/image-43.png" alt="" style="width:441px;height:auto" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-43-xs.png 640w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-43-sm.png 768w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-43-md.png 1024w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-43-lg.png 1366w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-43-xl.png 1600w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-43-2xl.png 1920w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>My approach is something like: Orange Pi/RPi with webcam, run Python script with a trained Tensorflow model. This output can then be transmitted to an Arduino / ESP32 / Lego Pybricks robot, perhaps through Serial UART. (If you don't know, Pybricks is basically an open source OS for Lego Spike, we can do more stuff with it in essence.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>I immediately got resistance, he wanted to use an android phone to do the image recognition, which:</p><p></p><p></p><ol class="wp-block-list"><p></p><li>Increases costs, Orange Pi costs like 60-80 bux tops</li><p></p><p></p><li>Where do we get phones? Ask the parents to buy on top of this tuition class? Maybe that's just me but that is a tad bit unreasonable.</li><p></p></ol><p></p><p></p><p>So yeah, and then one final time he asked me not to mod the Lego Spike hub to Pybricks and just uses the default version 2 (Current is version 3, auto-update too if you connect to the App, so it's extra dumb) so that he can keep teaching to the students (Teach my foot, you can't even complete the objective of the competition). I quit after that, I thought if he is just doing 骗吃 and if I can criticize others for doing so, me continuing is basically hypocrisy and not only that I would be doing a disservice to robotics as a sector.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Robotics is fun and useful, but we need to approach it with the engineer's mindset, not just some tuition center curriculum thinking.</p><p></p><p></p><ol class="wp-block-list"><p></p><li>What's the objective?</li><p></p><p></p><li>What's the constraints?</li><p></p><p></p><li>What's the minimum setup or hardware that we can use to complete the objective?</li><p></p><p></p><li>Do we need to learn how to use new hardware?</li><p></p><p></p><li>Do we need to adopt new skillsets?</li><p></p><p></p><li>Are the overall costs acceptable?</li><p></p><p></p><li>Is the success rate acceptable?</li><p></p></ol><p></p><p></p><p>Ehh, maybe it's just me, but his reasoning to me sounded like: "I don't know how to code outside of using the drag and drop Lego Spike App, I might be exposed as lacking if someone outside the system started to use alternative pathways (maybe even the only pathway for this competition <strong>he</strong> chose to participate in) to complete the objectives better, thus I will use the "easier to teach students" as an excuse to not allow changes to my system."</p><p></p><p></p><p>As an aside, this is definitely a bias in me but I highly dislike drag and drop apps, I worked with a CCA-mate back in JC in the Robotics Club and boy, do I hate drag and drop coding apps. (1. There's a learning curve; 2. Nigh unreadable) So from my view, while it may be easier and entertaining to learn for kids, it's the same as instilling a bad habit in kids who might consider specializing in robotics for his future job which is a huge disservice to them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I would advise parents to sign them up to enrichment centers with a refined curriculum instead of "We are going to send you kids to NRC in 3 months time!", because let's be real, the kids are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">not </span></strong>building or coding the robot, the trainers do, they just blindly execute the code during the competition and that's about it. <strong>Not only are you spending lots of money (in SG), you are also spending away the kids childhood, I don't think there's anything wrong with just playing and having fun with them.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-631"><img loading="lazy" src="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/image-45.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-45-xs.png 640w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-45-sm.png 768w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-45-md.png 1024w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-45-lg.png 1366w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-45-xl.png 1600w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/10/responsive/image-45-2xl.png 1920w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>I can roughly tell too this senior engineer is not an actual engineer cuz he don't know PID controls which is extremely common for Line Following Robots, and PID controls is considered the industrial basic for EE grads. He can teach primary school kids I will give him that, but when he signed up for AI Maker NRC and force everyone to join with his rules ( know that the rulebook straight up said "Any controller and material is allowed", which imo is the biggest hint), he basically shot everyone in the foot and points a shotgun at his own.</p><p></p><p></p><p>All in all, I thought robotics + AI is a terrible idea to teach primary school (below P5 is really bad imo) kids cuz they can barely pay attention for more than 2-3 minutes at a time and even then they lack the maths skills to even comprehend the code unless if they are very gifted.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Alright, I'll sign off for now, hope this article gave you some pause and thoughts about the concept of enrichment centers for kids. My feelings about this whole thing is: Robotics is a craft. And like any craft, it deserves real tools, real skills, and real respect.</p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 9, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/tags/life/">life</a></li><li><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/tags/writing/">writing</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/authors/franky-laurentis/" rel="author">Franky Laurentis</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/esp32-based-washing-machine-sensor.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> ESP32-based washing machine sensor</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/the-making-of-a-modular-3d-printed-line-following-robot-kit-v1-in-progress-untested.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The Making of a Modular 3D-printed Line Following Robot Kit [V1-in progress-untested]</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/authors/franky-laurentis/" class="feed__author">Franky Laurentis</a> <time datetime="2025-06-16T17:01" class="feed__date">June 16, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/non-technical-ramblings-on-the-topic-of-personal-philosophy-and-why-does-one-choose-to-leave-sg-for-batam.html">[Non-technical ramblings] On the topic of personal philosophy and why does one choose to leave SG for Batam?</a></h3></header><p>Alright, big question, some agree with my views when I talk about it, some thought it's pretty "bruh".
