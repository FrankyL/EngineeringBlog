So the content might not be what some people signed up for. Overall quite a decent mod, quite useful if you are interested to delve deeper into computer vision.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The module mostly deals with image processing and imaging geometry, i.e. the pre-processing that is done prior to the actual machine learning part</p><p></p><p></p><p>List of topics in Part 1: Digital Image Fundamentals, Image enhancement, Binary &amp; Color Processing, Image acquisition, Imaging geometry, Applications &amp; Design (Image pre-processing)</p><p></p><p></p><p>List of topics in Part 2: Noise and Filtering in Frequency Domain, Spatial Filtering, Image Segmentation, Conventional Machine Vision (kNN, SOM, SVM), Learning Based Machine Vision (AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet)</p><p></p><p></p><p>There are 2 projects for the module, the 1st one is more on pre-processing and segmenting images, the 2nd one is training an SVM network to recognize letters/alphabets.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There is also a final exam that is open-book. It's tough without LLM assistance though and I recommend practicing applying the formulas given in the lecture notes before you go into it.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>ME5404 Neural Networks [2324-SEM2]</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>This is one boring module, might be difficult for people who is weaker in maths and well within expectations on what one expects of a module named Neural Networks.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Topics covered: single and multilayer perceptrons, RBFN, Kohonen, principal component analysis, CNN, SVMs and Some RL stuff like Markov, Bellman and Q-learning.</p><p></p><p></p><p>40% goes to CA assignments, 20% is for part 1, split into 3 assignments (some Matlab and some "exam" questions), 20% to part 2, split into 2 mini projects (also Matlab, 1st on SVM and 2nd on Q-learning)</p><p></p><p></p><p>60% is final exam with 1 page cheat sheet and 4 questions, nothing one can't handle with the some preparation,</p><p></p><p></p><p>In my opinion, Part 1 lecturer is better and easier to understand. Part 2 lecturer focuses on the formulation and maths so much that you can't tell what is the intention of the stuff being taught. At some point, I ended up consulting chatgpt and Youtube tutorials on how Q-learning is supposed to work with how confusing the lecture and notes is.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>ME5608 Additive and Non-Conventional Manufacturing Processes [2425-SEM1]</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Easygoing mod, goes quite in depth into modern manufacturing methods, additive (3D printing types) and non-conventional (EDM and others)</p><p></p><p></p><p>40% on a term paper with a list of topics to choose from, and then we need to make a PowerPoint recorded presentation with an additional 10%. End up picking the topic of 3D printing soft materials and its applications in soft robotics and actuators since I already had experience with soft robotics and TPU printing in the previous semester's ME5415.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Remaining 50% is an open book e-quiz. Computer is allowed, so yeah ChatGPT time, but still better if you have a semblance of understanding of the materials so that you can tell when the LLMs is being plain wrong. The setup is pretty troublesome though, the prof requires us to set up our phone to point towards us and our monitor screens at the same time.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>ME6505 Engineering Materials in Medicine [2425-SEM1]</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Also an easygoing mod, the assessments are both CAs, need to write on a chosen disease and its treatments and a chosen nanoparticle biomaterial and its medical application.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I wrote on Stroke for the 1st one and Selenium Nanoparticles (SeNPs) for the 2nd one. The mod is interesting because the profs invite multiple guest speakers from biomed engineering industry who will talk about product development, testing and certifications.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>ME5404 Neural Networks [2324-SEM2]</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>This is one boring module, might be difficult for people who is weaker in maths and well within expectations on what one expects of a module named Neural Networks.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Topics covered: single and multilayer perceptrons, RBFN, Kohonen, principal component analysis, CNN, SVMs and Some RL stuff like Markov, Bellman and Q-learning.</p><p></p><p></p><p>40% goes to CA assignments, 20% is for part 1, split into 3 assignments (some Matlab and some "exam" questions), 20% to part 2, split into 2 mini projects (also Matlab, 1st on SVM and 2nd on Q-learning)</p><p></p><p></p><p>60% is final exam with 1 page cheat sheet and 4 questions, nothing one can't handle with the some preparation,</p><p></p><p></p><p>In my opinion, Part 1 lecturer is better and easier to understand.
