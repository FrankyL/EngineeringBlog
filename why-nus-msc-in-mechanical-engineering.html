If you can't complete the course in time or ASAP, you pay more. So yeah, I honestly have not much confidence in formalized research nor do I think I have an idea worth putting into a research paper at the time. I thought it will probably take more than 2 years to get this Masters thing over with, then it will also costs more.</li><p></p><p></p><li>VS <strong>PhD</strong>. I don't have confidence in masters by research, why do you think this is a good idea?</li><p></p><p></p><li>VS <strong>M.Sc. in CS</strong>. My software skillz is mediocre, I am self aware enough to not sugarcoat it. I operate best when there is a hardware to tweak and control, not pure algorithm, leetcode stuff. You can tell this from the way I reviewed the ML mods in the M.Sc. already. Something like managing 4MB worth of RAM in a really tiny hardware while also trying to figure out why the connected modules are not responding is my jam, you get the point. (Also I think CS or AI (Where laid off SDEs pivot towards) these days is a horrible idea, the competition is insane, with diminishing pay if not outright outsourcing.)</li><p></p><p></p><li>VS <strong>M.Sc. in Robotics</strong>. Back when I am enrolling into this M.Sc., the robotics one costs a whopping total of <strong>48k SGD</strong>, while this ME one costs 25k iirc. The ME course also allow access to Robotics mod except maybe the robotics project, so I was like eh close enough, and that sounds like a pretty good deal.</li><p></p><p></p><li>VS <strong>M.Sc. in EE</strong>. <strong>Same pricing</strong> as robotics back in 2023, not sure why either, might be different now. Tbh I thought it's a better idea to get a taste of ME for once, I already know the "other sectors" of EE outside of robotics/controls like antenna, power and semiconds, and<strong> I honestly felt pretty eh in going back to deal with them</strong>. I thought high chance it will feel like the TITech(Tokyo Inst. of Tech.) masters courses from my exchange in 2017.</li><p></p><p></p><li>Go <strong>overseas</strong>. Oh man... you think I don't want to? I have obligations, you know. However, if you are serious about continuing your studies and okay with going overseas, <strong>I will always shill CN, TW or JP</strong> to you guys. They are generally cheaper and also quite dense in terms of content (also a chance to go off and experience life in another country). <strong>UK, Aust. and US</strong> are <strong>insanely expensive</strong> even compared to SG (which I already consider pretty expensive, might be me griping cuz NUS charged us up the ass and only goes around building and improving the other faculties, Engi only got the upgrade after I grad from B.Eng. It's a bit better these days, at least every lecture halls is <strong>finally </strong>guaranteed to have working power sockets, that's a huge QOL improvement)</li><p></p></ol><p></p><p></p><p>This is a quick, fun write up, lots of people don't actually know the different pricing mechanism for masters by research/PhD and also the difference in tuition fees. I hope this is helpful.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I might actually consider PhD (biomed/prosthetics this time round maybe?) if I am bored with life again. Probably gonna use it as an excuse to hop to another country for a couple of years. JP, CN or TW sounds pretty nice.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This is most likely going to be my last post on NUS module reviews for now. The next ones going to be back to engineering works or JLPT again.</p><p></p><p></p><p>See ya!</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><figure class="wp-image-451"><img loading="lazy" src="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/image-20.png" alt="" style="width:265px;height:auto" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-20-xs.png 640w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-20-sm.png 768w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-20-md.png 1024w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-20-lg.png 1366w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-20-xl.png 1600w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-20-2xl.png 1920w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Small tangent</h2><p></p><p></p><p>I am also well aware there's an option to do PhD straight away after Bachelors. Ehh, you do you i guess, as I have noted earlier, would have been a huge pain in the ass to fund back then cuz I would still be of foreign student status. Although I will usually advise people to get some real world exp first tbh. I have taken over a research fellow's iot project before and imagine my surprise when it's revealed she dunno how to solder and outsourced it to a shop in Chinatown. It works, but barely, and it makes everyone's job harder than it already is. (Actually wasted like half of the grant's time period too feelsbadman, also doesn't look good if you know what I mean, *wink wink nudge nudge*)</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><figure class="wp-image-461"><img loading="lazy" src="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/image-21.png" alt="" style="width:181px;height:auto" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-21-xs.png 640w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-21-sm.png 768w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-21-md.png 1024w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-21-lg.png 1366w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-21-xl.png 1600w, https://frankyl.github.io/EngineeringBlog/media/posts/22/responsive/image-21-2xl.png 1920w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>IMO, 99.99% of the collective human knowledge can be accessed from your pocket, I honestly think the age of pure reliance on schools/academia to gain knowledge and know-hows is over. Hell, I used MIT MOOC and YouTube to quickly catch up on the prerequisite knowledge for the Masters level robust controls back during the TITech exchange in my Year 3 B.Eng. and that was back in 2018.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Quick aside that I also know another Mech Eng person who dropped out of their biomed / prosthetic research PhD. Without electronics, this seemingly unrelated topic easily rocketed up in difficulty, modern prosthetic with a pure mechanical background? You better be the god of mechanical design. I hope this reinforces my point further.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In short this might rile some people up, but consider the following:</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p></p><p><strong>There's nothing wrong with having skills first, then getting the paper to 'back it up'.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>On the other hand, getting exposed for lacking what should be basic skills even though you have the paper is absolutely, not pretty.</strong></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p>Food for thought.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Disclaimer: These are my personal reasons and priorities. Your mileage may vary — everyone's situation, goals, and risk appetite are different</span></strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Tangent over.
